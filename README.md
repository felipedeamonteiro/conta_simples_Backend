# Hiring Test - Conta Simples
This is a backend aplication to the fullstack developer job in the company Conta Simples


## - Specifications and technologies used here

This project was built using `Nodejs` with `Typescript`.

Here, `node` version is `12.16.3` and the package manager used is `yarn` in version `1.22.5`.

The database used is `Postgres` with `Typeorm` as ORM (object-relational mapping). Besides that, the database is running in a `docker` image of postgres.

In tests, it's used `Jest` and `Coverage` reports to help.

To test the APIs it was used [`Insomnia`](https://insomnia.rest/) and [`DBeaver - v:7.2.1`](https://dbeaver.io/) as a database administration tool.

## - How to run the project

### Docker

First of all, it's needed to install docker and download the postgres image. To install docker I suggest following instructions in this [link](https://www.notion.so/Instalando-Docker-6290d9994b0b4555a153576a1d97bee2#c7e37c6a26584d33b20cf332f2bdb31d).

After the instalation of docker, we need to create the database container with the correct image. [Here](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) you can see the docs of how to download the latest image from Postgres, but here's my suggestion to create the container and downloading image. It's important to follow the `password` and `ports` configuration as they are here. It's better to follow the command in terminal:
```
docker run --name conta_simples -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=docker -p 5434:5432 -d postgres
```
After creating the container and downloading image, run to check if everything is ok:
```
docker ps
```
### DBeaver

To visualize the database with Dbeaver, open it and click:
- New database connection
- Postgres

A window will open with tab `Main`. There you should set:
- Host: localhost
- Port: 5434
- Database: postgres
- Username: postgres
- Password: docker

In tab `PostgresQL`:
- Show all database: `check the box`

### Project

After downloading the code from the repository (and letting the docker running), run `yarn` to install all the dependencies.

After that, we need to create the tables in database, so run:
```
yarn typeorm migration:run
```
After that, to finish, run:
```
yarn dev:server
```
A message like this should appear in terminal:
```
ü§ëÔ∏è Server started on port 3334!
```
If so, enjoy the application!
